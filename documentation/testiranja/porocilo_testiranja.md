# Test Description and Performance Analysis

## Test Description / Mila Nastoska

### 1. **Positive Test: Retrieving Meals**
- **What it tests:** Ensures that the controller retrieves recipes categorized as meals.
- **Why it's important:** Verifies proper filtering by food type.

### 2. **Negative Test: Retrieving Meals When None Are Available**
- **What it tests:** Confirms that the controller returns an empty list when no meals are saved.
- **Why it's important:** Ensures the controller handles an empty filter query correctly.

### 3. **Positive Test: Deleting a Recipe**
- **What it tests:** Verifies that a recipe is removed from the repository after a delete operation.
- **Why it's important:** Confirms correct implementation of the delete functionality.

### 4. **Negative Test: Deleting a Non-Existent Recipe**
- **What it tests:** Ensures that deleting a recipe that doesnâ€™t exist does not affect the repository.
- **Why it's important:** Validates the robustness of the delete operation.

### 5. **Positive Test: Updating a Recipe**
- **What it tests:** Confirms that an existing recipe is correctly updated with new data.
- **Why it's important:** Verifies that updates to recipes are handled correctly.

### 6. **Negative Test: Updating a Recipe with Invalid Data**
- **What it tests:** Ensures that updating a recipe with invalid data (e.g., empty name) returns a `BAD_REQUEST` status and does not save changes.
- **Why it's important:** Prevents saving incomplete or invalid updates.

## Performance Analysis
### Identified Issues:

1. **Incorrect Filtering for Meals:**
   - **Issue:** The `getMeals` method initially returned incorrect results when no meals were present.
   - **Solution:** Updated the query to correctly filter and return only meals.

2. **Robustness of Deletion:**
   - **Issue:** Deleting non-existent recipes did not handle the case gracefully.
   - **Solution:** Ensured that the delete method checks the recipe's existence before attempting the operation.

3. **Update Method Error Handling:**
   - **Issue:** Invalid updates were saved, causing data corruption.
   - **Solution:** Added proper error handling and status code responses for invalid updates.

### 1. **Positive Test: Adding a Recipe**
- **What it tests:** Verifies that a valid recipe is successfully saved in the repository.
- **Why it's important:** Ensures the core functionality of adding recipes works correctly.

### 2. **Negative Test: Adding a Recipe with Missing Data**
- **What it tests:** Checks that the controller throws an exception when attempting to add an incomplete recipe (e.g., missing ingredients).
- **Why it's important:** Ensures data validation and prevents invalid recipes from being saved.

### 3. **Positive Test: Retrieving All Recipes**
- **What it tests:** Confirms that the controller retrieves all saved recipes from the repository.
- **Why it's important:** Ensures users can view the list of recipes.

### 4. **Negative Test: Retrieving Recipes When None Are Available**
- **What it tests:** Validates that the controller returns an empty list when no recipes are saved.
- **Why it's important:** Ensures correct handling of an empty dataset.

### 5. **Positive Test: Exporting Recipes to Excel**
- **What it tests:** Verifies that recipes are successfully exported to an Excel file without errors.
- **Why it's important:** Ensures that the service can generate Excel files containing valid recipe data, which is a core feature for users requiring data export functionality.

### 6. **Negative Test: Exporting Without Recipes**
- **What it tests:** Ensures that exporting an empty list of recipes produces a valid but empty Excel file.
- **Why it's important:** Confirms that the service handles edge cases gracefully, such as when no data is available for export.

## Performance Analysis
### Identified Issues:

1. **Validation for Incomplete Data:**
   - **Issue:** Adding or updating recipes with incomplete data was initially allowed.
   - **Solution:** Introduced validation to enforce completeness (e.g., non-empty name and valid ingredients).

2. **Empty Data Handling:**
   - **Issue:** The service initially lacked clear handling for empty recipe lists, potentially leading to ambiguous behavior.
   - **Solution:** Ensured the service generates an empty Excel file with appropriate structure (a single empty sheet).
