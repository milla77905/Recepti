# Progress Report - Kanban Documentation

## 1. User Story
**As a user, I want the ability to adjust nutritional values based on the number of servings so that I can plan meals accurately.**

## 2. Kanban Setup
- **Kanban Board**: A Kanban board has been created on GitHub to manage tasks.
- **WIP Limit**: A Work In Progress (WIP) limit of 3 tasks has been defined to ensure focus and minimize context switching.
- **Task Prioritization**: Tasks are labeled with priorities:
  - **High**: Must-have features.
  - **Medium**: Features important for functionality but can be deferred.
  - **Low**: Optional features or improvements.

## 3. Tasks and Task Assignments
The functionality was divided into smaller tasks based on Kanban principles. The tasks were estimated in points, and their priorities were defined.

### 3.1 Backend - Adding 'nutritional values' to `Recipes.java`
- **Estimated Cost**: 8 points
- **Priority**: High
- **Who**: Mila

### 3.2 Frontend - Displaying and Updating 'nutritional values' (view)
- **Estimated Cost**: 8 points
- **Priority**: High
- **Who**: Miha

- **Regular Updates**: The board is updated daily to reflect the latest progress and ensure transparency.

## 5. Conclusion
The nutritional values functionality is being developed according to the Kanban methodology. Tasks are managed on a GitHub Kanban board, and progress is continuously tracked and updated.
